## 🤖 GitHub Actions

### 🔄 Automatic Favicon and Header Image Updates

This repository includes a GitHub Actions that automatically updates the favicon and header image based on my GitHub avatar.

#### 🤔 How It Works

1. **Runs every hour** via a scheduled cron job (`0 * * * *`), or can be triggered manually.
2. Fetches the latest avatar from my GitHub profile.
3. Compares the new avatar with the stored hash to detect changes.
4. If the avatar has changed, the following files are updated:
   - `.avatar_hash` – stores the hash of the current avatar.
   - `app/favicon.ico` – used for the site's favicon.
   - `public/images/avatar.png` – used for the site's header image.
5. Commits and pushes the changes automatically.

#### 🗃️ Related Files

- **Action**: `.github/workflows/update-favicon.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/check_avatar.py`
- **Cache**: `.avatar_hash`

This ensures the site's favicon and header image are always up-to-date with my GitHub avatar.

### 🔄 Automatic Screenshot Updates

This repository includes a GitHub Actions that automatically updates the screenshots in the README file after a successful deployment to Vercel.

#### 🤔 How It Works

1. **Runs on every successful deployment** to Vercel.
2. Uses `puppeteer` to take screenshots of the website in both light and dark modes.
3. Saves the screenshots as `screenshot-light.png` and `screenshot-dark.png`.
4. If the screenshots have changed, it commits and pushes the changes to the repository.

### 🗃️ Related Files

- **Action**: `.github/workflows/update-screenshots.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/update_screenshots.py`

This ensures the README file always has up-to-date screenshots of the website.
