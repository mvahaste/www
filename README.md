   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your `FORM_ENDPOINT`:

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions

This repository includes two GitHub Actions that automate the process of updating the favicon and screenshots based on the current state of my GitHub profile.

### üñºÔ∏è Automatic Favicon Update

This action keeps the site's favicon and header image in sync with my GitHub profile picture.

#### ü§î How It Works

1. **Runs every hour** via a scheduled cron job (`0 * * * *`), or can be triggered manually.
2. Fetches the latest avatar from my GitHub profile.
3. Compares the new avatar with the stored hash to detect changes.
4. If the avatar has changed, the following files are updated:
   - `.avatar_hash` ‚Äì stores the hash of the current avatar.
   - `app/favicon.ico` ‚Äì used for the site's favicon.
   - `public/images/avatar.png` ‚Äì used for the site's header image.
5. Commits and pushes the changes automatically.

#### üóÉÔ∏è Related Files

- **Action**: `.github/workflows/update-favicon.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/check_avatar.py`
- **Cache**: `.avatar_hash`

This ensures the site's visuals stay synced with my GitHub profile.

### üì∏ Automated Screenshot Updates

This action automatically captures full-page screenshots of the site in both light and dark mode. It should be triggered automatically after every successful deployment, but for now it's set to manual only to avoid loops.

#### ü§î How It Works

1. **Triggered after every successful Vercel deployment**, or manually (currently manual only).
2. Runs a script that:
   - Sets the site's theme (light or dark) via local storage.
   - Waits for page load and animations to complete.
   - Captures a screenshot of the page in the selected theme.
3. Saves the screenshots as `screenshot-light.png` and `screenshot-dark.png`.
4. Commits and pushes the changes automatically.

#### üóÉÔ∏è Related Files

- **Action**: `.github/workflows/update-screenshots.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/take_screenshot.js`

This ensures that the latest visual state of the site is reflected in the README with up-to-date screenshots in both themes.
