# 🌲 mvahaste.dev

This is my personal website, hosted at [mvahaste.dev](https://mvahaste.dev). It's designed with a clean, responsive layout and features simple animations for a bit of character. This repository is pretty overkill for what it is, but I enjoy working on it.

## 🤖 GitHub Actions

### 🔄 Automatic Favicon and Header Image Updates

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that keeps the site's favicon and header image in sync with my GitHub avatar.

#### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Runs hourly** via a scheduled cron job (`0 * * * *`) or can be triggered manually.
2. Retrieves the latest avatar from my GitHub profile.
3. Compares the fetched avatar with a stored hash to detect changes.
4. If a change is detected, it updates the following files:
   - `.avatar_hash` – stores the hash of the current avatar.
   - `app/favicon.ico` – used as the site’s favicon.
   - `public/images/avatar.png` – used as the header image.
5. Automatically commits and pushes the updated files.

> The GitHub username is sourced from a default environment variable — no hardcoding involved.

#### 🗃️ Relevant Files

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/update-favicon.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/check_avatar.py`
- **Hash File**: `.avatar_hash`

This ensures the site's visuals remain current with my GitHub profile.

### 🔄 Automatic Screenshot Updates

This repository also includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically updates the screenshots in the README to keep them up to date.

#### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Triggered on every push** to the `main` branch or can be triggered manually.
2. Uses `puppeteer` to capture screenshots of the site with all color themes in both light and dark modes.
3. Saves the screenshots `<theme>-<mode>.png` in the `screenshots/` directory.
4. If any changes are detected, the updated screenshots are committed and pushed automatically.

To prevent infinite loops, the workflow is set to ignore changes to the `screenshots/` directory, as well as a few other files that should not trigger the workflow.

> The repository name, API URL, and access token are all pulled from default environment variables — no hardcoding.

#### 🗃️ Relevant Files

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/update-screenshots.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/update_screenshots.js`

This ensures the README always reflects the latest visual state of the website.
