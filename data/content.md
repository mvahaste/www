## Hi, I'm Mikk <WaveEmoji />

I'm a **22-year-old** student at the **University of Tartu**, currently in my second year, mainly focusing on **web development**. I've always been into computers and programming—I first started messing around with Python and quickly got hooked on web development, doing both front and back-end, with a larger focus on the former.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing video games—**ELDEN RING** and **Subnautica** are probably my favorites, followed by the rest of the **Souls** games. I also listen to a lot of music, hit the gym and occasionally read when I get the chance.
