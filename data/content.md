## Hi, I'm Mikk <WaveEmoji />

I'm a **22-year-old** informatics student at the **University of Tartu**, mainly focused on **front-end** with some back-end experience. I got into coding through Python and quickly found my way to web development.

Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming—my favorites are **ELDEN RING** and **Subnautica**, followed by the rest of the **Souls** series—listening to music, going to the gym, and reading when I get the chance.
