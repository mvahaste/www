## Hi, I'm Mikk <WaveEmoji />

I'm a **23-year-old** Informatics student at the **University of Tartu**, mainly focused on front-end development with some back-end experience. I enjoy building clean, functional user interfaces, and I'm interested in growing as a full-stack developer.

I'm also interested in homelabbing and self-hosting, as well as reading and playing video games. I especially love soulsborne games, with **DARK SOULS I** and **ELDEN RING** being my favorites.
